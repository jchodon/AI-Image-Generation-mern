<h4 id ="#overview" align="center">This AI Image Generation App is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. It leverages the OpenAI API(DALL-E) for the creation and management of a gallery of unique, AI-generated images. Additionally, the app uses Cloudinary for cloud-based image storage, with the URLs of the stored images being saved in MongoDB.
